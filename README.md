# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze and create relationships between multiple datasets using SQL language and running the datas in pgAdmin environment.

Using the tools and data provided to us, we were able to create new tables, reports and determined the following analysis:
- The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results:

**Table 1: Retiring Employees by Title**

**Table 2: Eligible for the Mentorship Program by Title**

![Eligible_Mentorship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mishabatoon/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/main/Screenshots/eligible_mentorship.png)

- There are 90,398 total employees eligible for retirement whose birth dates are between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
- The highest number of retiring title is "Senior Engineer" with a total of 29,414 employees.
- The lowest number of retiring title is "Manager" with a only 2 employees.
-  Out of 90,398 retiring employees, only 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program (Refer to Table 2)


## Summary:

There are 90,398 total employees who are retiring and that is about 30% of the total employees in the company. 

Good next steps for Human Resources and hiring Managers to consider would be:
- to query and create a table for the number of positions that need backfilling within the various departments. 
(This information would be useful to reveal the departments that are the most and least impacted by a wave of retirements)
- a query that will determine the average salary range for each position/title by department so that they can project or forecast the budget for the salary payables for the next coming years.
